Strong gravitational lensing (SGL) and stellar dynamics are powerful tools for studying galaxy properties, such as their stellar and dark matter (DM) contents, the mass density slope, and cosmological parameters. Both SGL and stellar dynamics probe the same physical mass: the mass that bends light in SGL also binds stars within the galaxy's gravitational pull. While limitations of each technique are well-understood, their combined potential and the development of self-consistent models remain relatively unexplored. By combining these tracers, we can overcome degeneracies inherent to individual methods and obtain more reliable measurements of galaxy mass profiles. However, the reliability of these combined measurements and strategies for further improvement requires investigation. In this work, we address these issues using the high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations llustrisTNG50. Through TNG50 we generate mock observational stellar kinematics and gravitational lensing data. We then explore how the self-consistent modelling of stellar dynamics and lensing can recover integrated measurements of total mass, stellar mass, and DM content of early-type galaxies. We find that the combined model consistently outperforms the individual methods (dynamics or lensing alone), exhibiting smaller median fractional differences. Specifically, it recovers the intrinsic total mass within 2.5Reff with a 2% accuracy and the total mass density slope with a 5% accuracy. On the other hand, the parameters describing the DM halo are poorly constrained by all models. We also verify the impact of the number of kinematic constraints on the assessment of the interesting quantities and we find a minimal influence.
