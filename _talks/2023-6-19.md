General Relativity (GR) has been successfully tested mainly at Solar system scales; however, galaxy-scale tests have become popular in the last few decades. In this presentation, I will present our work where we investigate the \(\eta_\text{PPN}\) parameter, which is commonly defined by the ratio of two scalar potentials that appears in the cosmological linearly perturbed metric. Under the assumption of GR and a vanishing anisotropic stress tensor, \(\eta_\text{PPN}=1\). Using ALMA, HST, and VLT/MUSE data, we combine mass measurements, from gravitational lensing and galactic dynamics, for the SDP.81 lens galaxy \((z=0.299)\) to constrain \(\eta_\text{PPN}\) and probe GR at galactic scales at unprecedented redshift. We assume a self-consistent mass profile, parameterised by a sum of elliptical Gaussians, which allows us to decompose the mass profile into two components: (i) a stellar-mass component, obtained by deprojecting the observed lens surface brightness profile; (ii) a dark matter halo, described by an NFW profile. Using the fiducial model, we reconstructed the lensed galaxy and the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the lens, as well as probe GR through \(\eta_\text{PPN}\). We infer, after accounting for systematic uncertainties related to the mass model, cosmology and kinematics, \(\eta_\text{PPN} = 1.13^{+0.03}_{-0.03}\pm0.20\,(\text{sys})\), which is in accordance with GR predictions. I will also present preliminary results of our ongoing work using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to characterise these systematics and design better future observations.
