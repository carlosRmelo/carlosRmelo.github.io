Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside at the centre of massive galaxies, with their masses tightly linked to the properties of their hosts through a co-evolutionary process over cosmic time. For massive elliptical galaxies, this connection is encapsulated in the MBH-𝝈e relation, which ties the SMBH mass (MBH​) to the host’s central stellar velocity dispersion (𝝈e​). However, traditional methods for measuring SMBH masses rely on stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies (z lower than 0.1), leaving the evolution of SMBHs at higher redshifts largely unexplored. In this work, we combine 2D stellar dynamics and gravitational lensing to analyse the Cosmic Horseshoe, a massive galaxy at z=0.44. Using IFU data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we simultaneously model the radial lensing features and stellar kinematics, providing unprecedented constraints on the lens central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Through Bayesian model comparison, we report a 5σ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with log10(MBH/Msun) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} ± (0.12){sys}, robust against systematic uncertainties. Intriguingly, the Cosmic Horseshoe lies ∼1.5σ above the local MBH-𝝈e relation, aligning with emerging evidence that the most massive galaxies may follow a steeper MBH-𝝈e relationship. This suggests a distinct co-evolutionary pathway for SMBHs and their hosts at the highest mass scales. Looking ahead, future surveys will uncover more radial arcs like the ones in the Cosmic Horseshoe, enabling the detection of SMBHs across a wider range of redshifts and masses. These discoveries will refine our understanding of the MBH-𝝈e relation and its evolution, shedding light on the growth of SMBHs and their host galaxies over cosmic time.
