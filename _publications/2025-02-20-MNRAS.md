Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass (\(M_\text{BH}\)) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion (\(\sigma_e\)), via the \(M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e\) relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies (\(z < 0.1\)), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system (\(z = 0.44\)), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a \(5\sigma\) detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with \(\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}\), consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe \(\sim\)\(1.5\sigma\) above the \(M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e\) relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper \(M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e\) relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the \(M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e\) relation and its evolution across cosmic time.
