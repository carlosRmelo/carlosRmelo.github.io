This mini course is designed to introduce students to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_sampling_algorithm" target="_blank">nested sampling</a>, a powerful computational technique used in Bayesian inference for estimating the Bayesian evidence and exploring complex posterior distributions. The course covers the theoretical foundations of nested sampling, and practical applications using the <a href="https://dynesty.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">dynesty package</a>, a widely used implementation of nested sampling in Python.
