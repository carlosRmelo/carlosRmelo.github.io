<blockquote>
  <p>The basic question the person wants to ask and answer is "Who am I? What is the meaning of my life? What value does it have?" And we can only get answers to these questions by reviewing our relationships to others, what we do to others and for others, and what kind of response we get from them.</p>

Hello folks! Although I cannot give a final answer to this question, I can give some hints.
I'm a Brazilian PhD candidate in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, working in strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics. My research focuses on integrating these phenomena  to deepen our understanding of galaxies and the Universe. In particular, I have been working on improving this combination of strong gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics to more accurately probe the mass distribution of early-type galaxies acting as gravitational lenses. Additionally, I'm exploring how this information on mass distribution can be utilised to test theories of gravity. Furthermore, I'm also exploring how this information on the mass distribution can be used to test gravity and galaxy evolution. My (academic) interests include exploring new methods in strong lensing and stellar dynamics, galaxy evolution, hydrodynamical simulations, and finding creative ways to combine all of these areas.

Previously, I received an MSc in Astrophysics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (2021) and BSc in Physics from the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (2019). In 2024, I went to a PhD internship at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation in Portsmouth/UK.

Apart from that, I’m passionate about literature (especially sci-fi), cinema, and podcasts. I’m also a big fan of good food (but who isn’t?) and a beginner runner (we’ll see how long that lasts).
