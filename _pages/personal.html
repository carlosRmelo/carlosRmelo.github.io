<!-- This is a personal compilation of myself by ... myself (?) -->
<br>
Here you'll find a brief list of books I've read recently. Since I started this list only one year ago (and don't have as much time as I used to have), it's quite short, but I promise it's honest.
Books I strongly recommend are starred.

<div class="container">
  <br>
  <div class="last-update">Last updated {{ site.data.reading.lastupdate }}</div>
  {% for entry in site.data.reading.list %}
  <div class="year-container">
    <div class="year">
      <h4>{{ entry.year }}</h4>
      <div class="number">{{ entry.books | size }} books</div>
    </div>
    <div class="books">
      <ul class="reading-list {{ entry.year }}">
        {% for book in entry.books %}
        <li>
          {% if book.link %}
            <a href="{{ book.link }}" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">{{ book.title }}</a>
          {% else %}
              {{ book.title }}
          {% endif %}
          <span class="author">by {{ book.author }}</span
          >{% if book.star %}<span class="star">â˜…</span>{% endif %}
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
